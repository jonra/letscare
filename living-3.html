                <h1>Religion</h1>
                <hr/>
                <p class="lead">Although Norway has a state church, it offers complete religious freedom. This means that everyone can practice their religion without being afraid of persecution or punishment. This also means that every individual is free to choose the religion they wish to follow. Equally as important is that every individual is also free to not be part of a religious community.</p>

                The largest religious community in Norway is the Church of Norway. Around 80 percent of the population is a member of this church. Although the number of members is high, this does not necessarily mean that religious plays a prominent role in people’s lives. Statistics show that, for example, only twelve percent of Norwegians go to church more than once a month. Thirty-seven percent state that they never go to church. All the same, the church is still important to most inhabitants for such ceremonies as baptisms, confirmations, weddings and funerals, in addition to Christmas.


                <h2>The different religious communities receive funding from the government</h2>
                <p>Religious and spiritual communities can receive economic support from the state government and municipality. Official religious and spiritual communities receive just as much funding for each of their members as the Church of Norway.</p>

                <h2>Norway is a multicultural and secular society</h2>
                <p>Christianity was introduced to Norway around 1,000 years ago and, since the Reformation in the 1500s, Lutheran Christianity (Protestantism) has been the dominant religion in Norway. In the past, Norwegians were not allowed to withdraw from the state church and it was only around a hundred years ago that it became legal to organise a non-Christian religious community in Norway. Today’s society is becoming more and more secular. This means that religion has become less important in society than in the past among private individuals and when drafting the country’s laws.</p>

                <h2>Different religious and spiritual groups in Norway</h2>
                <p>Around 20 percent of the Norway population does not belong to the state church. Approximately half of these people are members of other religious or spiritual communities, while the other half does not belong to any such group.</p>
